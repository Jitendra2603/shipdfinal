# Hints for Subtask 1

1. **Slight Hint**: Use a code editor library that supports Python syntax highlighting, such as **CodeMirror** or **Monaco Editor**.

2. **Moderate Hint**: Integrate **CodeMirror** into your React application by using the `@uiw/react-codemirror` package, and configure it to use the Python language mode.

3. **Strong Hint**: Implement the code editor as a React component with state hooks to manage the code input and output. For now, mock the backend API response when the "Run Code" button is clicked.
