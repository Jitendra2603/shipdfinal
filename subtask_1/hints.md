### Slight Hint:
Use a code editor library that supports Python syntax highlighting, such as **CodeMirror** or **Monaco Editor**.

---

### Moderate Hint:
Integrate **CodeMirror** into your React application by using the `@uiw/react-codemirror` package and configure it for **Python** language support.

---

### Strong Hint:
Implement the code editor as a **React component** with state hooks to manage the code input and output. Use the **fetch API** to send a **POST request** to the backend when the "Run Code" button is clicked, following the specified **endpoint** and **payload structure**. 

Since the backend is not implemented yet, **mock the API response**.
