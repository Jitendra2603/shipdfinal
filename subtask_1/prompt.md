# Subtask 1: Frontend Code Editor

Your task is to implement a frontend code editor that allows users to write Python code. The editor should have the following features:

- **Syntax Highlighting**: Support for Python syntax highlighting.
- **Code Input Area**: A text editor where users can write their Python code.
- **Run Code Button**: A button that sends the code to the backend API for execution.
- **Output Display**: An area where the output or error messages from the code execution are displayed.

**Requirements**:

- Use a modern JavaScript framework like **React**.
- Ensure the UI is responsive and user-friendly.
- Handle user inputs and outputs gracefully, providing feedback where necessary.

**Note**: At this stage, you can mock the backend API response to test your frontend implementation.
