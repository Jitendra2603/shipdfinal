# Subtask 1: Frontend Code Editor

Your task is to implement a frontend code editor that allows users to write Python code. The editor should have the following features:

- **Syntax Highlighting**: Support for Python syntax highlighting.
- **Code Input Area**: A text editor where users can write their Python code.
- **Run Code Button**: A button that, when clicked, displays a mock output in the output area.
- **Output Display**: An area where the output or error messages are displayed.

**Requirements**:

- Use **React** and create a new project using Create React App or Next.js.
- The application should be self-contained and runnable.
- Ensure the UI is responsive and user-friendly.
- For this subtask, you can mock the backend API response to test your frontend implementation.

**Specifications**:

- The code editor should be implemented in a component named `CodeEditor`.
- The "Run Code" button should trigger a function that sets a mock output (e.g., "Hello, World!") in the output area.
- The output area should be a read-only text area or a styled div.

**Instructions**:

- Set up your project structure, including all necessary configurations.
- Include any necessary dependencies in your `package.json`.
- Ensure that the application can be started using `npm start` or `yarn start`.
